## This is a very simple [personal website](https://dariocosta.dev/) I coded. Enjoy.

I used...
- **Tailwind CSS** for the responsive design.
- **Font Awesome** for the icons.
- **Google Fonts** for the - and you won't believe this - fonts.
- **Github Pages** to host the website.

[I also made a blog](https://github.com/dcostap/personal-blog)
